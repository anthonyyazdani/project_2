- 2 different data processing:

	- "self made"
	- "trivial"

THE FOLLOWING STEPS SHOULD BE DONE FOR THE TWO DIFFERENT DATA PROCESSING:

- 2 (or 3) different embeddings:
	- "self made" glove
	- Stanford twitter 200d glove
	- (Stanford 200d glove)

- Classical Machine Learning:
	- Naive bayes
	- Logistic regression
	- Multilayer perceptron

- Advanced methods:
	- LSMT
	- CNN
	- (CNN + LSTM)
